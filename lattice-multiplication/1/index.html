<p>Let's start with an example. Here's how to multiply some HUGE numbers. Let's try 1,643 &times; 2,293!</p>

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image of multiplying 1,643 by 2,293." width="500">

<p>According to the photo, the answer is 3,747,399. What a big number! Here's the check:</p>
<pre>
1,643 &times; 2,293 &thickapprox; 2,000 &times; 2,000
              = 4,000,000
</pre>
<p><b>Note for Big-O Notation experts:</b> This procedure take O(<var>n</var> &times; <var>m</var>) time, where <var>n</var> is the length of the first number, and <var>m</var> is the length of the second number. So there are 16 steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Multiply 3 by 2.</li>
  <li>Multiply 4 by 2.</li>
  <li>Multiply 6 by 2.</li>
  <li>Multiply 1 by 2.</li>
  <li>Multiply 3 by 2.</li>
  <li>Multiply 4 by 2.</li>
  <li>Multiply 6 by 2.</li>
  <li>Multiply 1 by 2.</li>
  <li>Multiply 3 by 9.</li>
  <li>Multiply 4 by 9.</li>
  <li>Multiply 6 by 9.</li>
  <li>Multiply 1 by 9.</li>
  <li>Multiply 3 by 3.</li>
  <li>Multiply 4 by 3.</li>
  <li>Multiply 6 by 3.</li>
  <li>Multiply 1 by 3.</li>
</ol>
<p>See? 16 steps! Because 4 &times; 4 equals 16!</p>
