<p>Let's start with an example. Here's how to multiply some HUGE numbers. Let's try 1,643 &times; 2,293!</p>

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image of multiplying 1,643 by 2,293." width="500">

<p>According to the photo, the answer is 3,747,399. What a big number! Here's the check:</p>
<pre>
1,643 &times; 2,293 &thickapprox; 2,000 &times; 2,000
              = (2 &times; 1,000)(2 &times; 1,000)
              = 2 &times; 1,000<sup>2</sup>
              = (2<sup>2</sup> &times; 1,000<sup>2</sup>)
              = 4((10<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup>)
              = 4(10<sup>6</sup>)
              = 4(1,000,000)
              = 4,000,000
</pre>
